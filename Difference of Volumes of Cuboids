//In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. 
//Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. 
//You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

function findDifference(a, b) {
  let first = a.reduce((acc, st) => acc * st)
  let second = b.reduce((acc, st) => acc * st)
