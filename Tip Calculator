/*
Complete the function, which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service.

You need to consider the following ratings:

Terrible: tip 0%
Poor: tip 5%
Good: tip 10%
Great: tip 15%
Excellent: tip 20%
The rating is case insensitive (so "great" = "GREAT"). If an unrecognised rating is received, then you need to return:

"Rating not recognised" in Javascript
Because you're a nice person, you always round up the tip, regardless of the service.
*/

function calculateTip(amount, rating) {
return rating.toLowerCase() === "Excellent".toLowerCase()? Math.ceil(amount*20/100)
  :rating.toLowerCase() === "Great".toLowerCase()? Math.ceil(amount*15/100)
  :rating.toLowerCase() === "Good".toLowerCase()? Math.ceil(amount*10/100)
  :rating.toLowerCase() === "Poor".toLowerCase()? Math.ceil(amount*5/100)
  :rating.toLowerCase() === "Terrible".toLowerCase()? 0
  : "Rating not recognised"
}
