//A triangle is called an equable triangle if its area equals its perimeter. 
//Return true, if it is an equable triangle, else return false. You will be provided with the length of sides of the triangle. Happy Coding!

let p = a+b+c
let s = p / 2;

return p === Math.sqrt(s * ((s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)));
